## Detailed Description (UPDATED with trademarks and more content)

Sheet Snip makes it easy to export your Google Sheets™ data in structured formats optimized for use with Large Language Models like ChatGPT, Claude, and others.

### FEATURES
• Export data in structured formats (row-based or column-based)

• Export both values and formulas simultaneously
• One-click clipboard copy
• Simple, intuitive interface
• Works directly within Google Sheets™

### HOW IT WORKS
Getting started with Sheet Snip is simple:

1. **Select your data**: Highlight any range of cells in your Google Sheet™
2. **Open Sheet Snip**: Go to Extensions menu > Sheet Snip
3. **Choose export format**:
   - Values only (cell contents)
   - Formulas only (cell formulas)
   - Both values and formulas together
4. **Preview the output**: Review the formatted output in the dialog
5. **Copy to clipboard**: One-click copy, ready to paste into your AI tool

The exported data is structured and formatted to be easily understood by Large Language Models, making it perfect for:
- Data analysis with AI assistants
- Sharing spreadsheet structures with colleagues
- Documenting complex formulas
- Creating backups of sheet content
- Feeding spreadsheet data to automation tools

### PRIVACY & SECURITY
Sheet Snip is built with privacy at its core:

• **Zero data collection** - We do not collect, store, or transmit any data from your spreadsheets
• **No external servers** - All processing happens entirely within your browser and Google Sheets™
• **Minimal permissions** - Read-only access to the current sheet only (we cannot modify your sheets or access other spreadsheets)
• **Local processing** - The data never leaves your device
• **Open source** - Full transparency with auditable code

### USE CASES
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Export data to ChatGPT, Claude, or other LLMs for insights
- **Documentation**: Capture and share spreadsheet structures
- **Formula Backup**: Save complex formulas in readable format
- **Data Migration**: Export data for use in other tools
- **Collaboration**: Share structured data with non-Google Sheets™ users
