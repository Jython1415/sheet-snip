# Privacy Policy for Sheets JSON Export

**Last Updated**: November 30, 2025

## Overview

Sheets JSON Export is a Google Sheets add-on that exports selected spreadsheet ranges to JSON format. This privacy policy explains our data practices.

## Key Principle: We Do Not Collect Your Data

Sheets JSON Export is designed with privacy at its core. We do not collect, store, transmit, or access your spreadsheet data.

## How Sheets JSON Export Works

1. You authorize the add-on to read your Google Sheet (read-only access)
2. The add-on processes your sheet data entirely within Google Sheets
3. You preview the JSON output in a modal dialog
4. You copy the JSON to your clipboard
5. The data never leaves your device and is not stored by us

## OAuth Scopes We Request

Sheets JSON Export requests the following permissions:

- **spreadsheets.currentonly**: To read data from your currently open spreadsheet only (we cannot modify your sheets or access other spreadsheets)
- **script.container.ui**: To display the export dialog and clipboard interface

These are the minimum scopes necessary for the stated functionality. We use the most restrictive scopes available to minimize permission requests.

## Data We Collect

We collect ZERO data about your spreadsheets:
- We do not log which sheets you export
- We do not store your spreadsheet contents
- We do not transmit your data to external servers
- We do not track the specific data you export

## Data Security

Your data security is ensured by its client-side processing:
- All JSON generation happens entirely within Google Sheets and your browser
- No transmission to external servers
- Uses HTTPS encryption for your connection to Google services
- No persistent storage of sheet contents in our systems

## Third-Party Services

The only third parties involved are Google (providing the Sheets API and hosting environment). We do not share your data with advertisers, analytics providers, or other third parties.

## Your Data Rights

Your spreadsheet data is yours. You may:
- Uninstall the add-on at any time
- Revoke authorization at any time through your Google Account settings
- Know that nothing persists in our systems after you close the dialog

## Compliance Statements

### Google API Services User Data Policy

The use of information received from Workspace APIs will adhere to the [Google User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.

We certify that we:
- Only use data to provide the JSON export functionality
- Do not transfer, share, or sell your data to third parties
- Do not use your data for advertising, credit decisions, or training AI models
- Do not use data beyond what is necessary for the stated purpose
- Maintain appropriate security measures to protect your data

### GDPR (European Users)

Since we collect no personal data from sheet contents, GDPR's data subject rights apply only to optional usage analytics (which you can disable). Your sheet data remains your property and under your control.

### CCPA (California Users)

We do not sell, buy, or share information. We do not collect personal information from your sheets.
